## [Characterization of Simplicial Complexes by Counting Simplets Beyond Four Nodes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05505.pdf)(WWW 2023)

### Key Question
How to calclulate the simplets, the counterpart concept of graphlets on SCs.

### Solution
Color coding

### Comments and Questions
Why graphlets are so important in graph mining method nowadays? Why could this be used in anomaly detection and more downstream tasks?

## [How Transitive Are Real-World Group Interactions? - Measurement and Reproduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02358.pdf)

### Key Question
How transtive are the Left-wing and Right-wing nodes in group wise?

### Solution
The author set up a series of axioms about the rule to set up a hyperedge-level measurement function(Axiom 1-5) and hypergraph-level measure(Axiom 6-7)

### Comments and Questions
What's the meaning of measuring tansitivity? Is that useful in link prediction or anything?

## [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

### Key Question
What is LSTM

### Solution
gate(sigmoid)

### Comments and Questions
Why $\theta$ is useful during prediction? How does it predict? After training, what has LSTM learned?
