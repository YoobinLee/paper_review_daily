## [HashNWalk: Hash and Random Walk Based Anomaly Detection in Hyperedge Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13822.pdf)(ICJAR 2022)

### Key Question
1. What kind of anomaly should be detected?
2. How to reduce the time and space compexity

### Solution
1. Anomaly categories
1.1. Unexpected sets of nodes(Using random walk transition matrix $P$, comparing $P$ based on timestamp(this time, last time).
1.2. Burst of same node pairs.

2. Reduce the time and space complexity
1.1. Approximately calculate $P$ to reduce time complexity
1.2. Using hash map to reduce space comlexity

### Comments and Questions
1. Hashing methods may omit some certain unexpected sets of nodes
